# Hardware

## What do I need to buy?

Lorem ipsum

At the end, it's always a clash between the two tech giants, Google and Apple + some shady shitty chinese companies.

## Chromecast ![Overall good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Overall%20most%20convenient-8A2BE2)

Overall, it's a good piece of hardware, comes in **HD** or **4K**.

Google just recently discontinued the chromecasts to push sales on their new overpriced Google TV device to make competition with Apple.
You can still easily find it in stock on eBay, keep in mind to not overpay for it as the retail is quite cheap.

## Nvidia Shield Pro ![Recommended](https://img.shields.io/badge/Best_option_with_high_budget-8A2BE2)

The last device of this series came in 2019. It's still the best on the market.

## Amazon Fire Stick ![Not Recommended](https://img.shields.io/badge/Not_recommended-D25C46)

It retails for about the same price as the (linka qua) chromecast, but it's renowed to be a very poor device.

It's a mix between awful custom Android TV os, poor hardware build, laggy. Better off with a Chromecast if your budget is that.

## Others

I've personally never tested any device apart those three, the market is flooded with cheap chinese crap...
